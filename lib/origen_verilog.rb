  # for testing), then these should be loaded from config/boot.rb

  # Example of how to explicitly require a file
  # require "origen_verilog/my_file"
  require 'origen_verilog/ast/node'

  # Load all files in the lib/origen_verilog directory.
  # Note that there is no problem from requiring a file twice (Ruby will ignore
  # the second require), so if you have a file that must be required first, then
  # explicitly require it up above and then let this take care of the rest.
